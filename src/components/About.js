        <p>
          I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong focus on building modern, efficient, and scalable web applications.
          I have extensive experience working with both frontend and backend technologies, and I enjoy turning ideas into functional and intuitive products.
        </p>
        <p>
          My full stack includes JavaScript and TypeScript for both client and server-side development. On the frontend, I work with React and Redux to build dynamic, responsive user interfaces.
          For the backend, I use Node.js and Express, with PostgreSQL and Sequelize for database management. I'm also comfortable with Docker for containerization and deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a firm believer in writing clean, maintainable code, and I prioritize collaboration in team environments. My approach to development focuses on problem-solving and creating seamless, user-centered experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of development, I enjoy listening to music, exploring new hobbies, and staying active through hiking and cycling. 
          I believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance helps keep me energized and sparks my creativity, which ultimately enhances my performance as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute my skills, grow as a developer, and work on projects that make a meaningful impact.
